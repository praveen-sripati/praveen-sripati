# Hi, I'm Praveen Sripati 👋

A dedicated web developer with a strong background in technology. Currently, I'm in a junior role at a well-known tech company, where I'm actively involved in creating and improving web experiences. 💻
  
Beyond coding, I have a deep passion for cricket 🏏, and I spend my weekends on the field enjoying the game. Additionally, I love exploring natural places and traveling to experience the beauty of different landscapes. 🌄 These interests provide a perfect balance to my tech-focused career.

As I continue to grow as a web developer, I look forward to merging my technological expertise with my love for sports and travel, creating a unique and fulfilling journey. 🚀
