# Hi, I'm Praveen Sripati üëã

As a Front-End Developer with a passion for crafting intuitive and dynamic user interfaces, I specialize in Angular and have hands-on experience with React and Node.js. My journey has taken me from building responsive web applications to developing full-stack personal projects, giving me a comprehensive understanding of the entire development lifecycle.

I believe that the best products are built at the intersection of clean code, creative problem-solving, and a user-centric approach. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and apply them to create meaningful digital experiences.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new destinations or on the cricket pitch with friends. I find that the same focus and teamwork required in sports translate directly to building successful development teams.

‚úçÔ∏è I also share my learnings and insights on my blogs:
